# bbbot.py

This is a python script that, when tuned properly, can beat the Guinness world record for the Facebook version of Bejewled Blitz.

It's messy and contains many hacks, so please don't expect it to magically work when you run it. Also, don't report issues. This is a hack and is not meant to be a production-ready piece of software.

It's meant to be played with, experimented with, and fine-tuned.

Also in this repository are some undocumented helper scripts for things like grabbing individual cell images from gamescreen screenshots. I'll let you figure those out on your own.

Have fun with it!

## Prerequisites

## Notes

My luck getting this to work with HiDPI screens is basically NIL, so if you embark on getting this thing working on your HiDPI system, start by lowering your resolution by half.
